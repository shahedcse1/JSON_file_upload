User must be able to upload a JSON file (vehicle_data.json) via form.
Uploaded data must be stored in a relational database. Recurring uploads must update existing database rows (instead
of duplicating the data).
User must be able to search existing database rows by using a free text search box (See figure 1). Search must be on
the same page as the upload form.
Search must be implemented as a “live” search, meaning that the search is listening for user input and the page doesn’t
reload in between searches
